      <description>Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps.
Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. In some instances, they can be hundreds of times faster and they often offer significantly better compression.
 Use Roaring for bitmap compression whenever possible. Do not use other bitmap compression methods (Wang et al.</description>

      <description>We have a Roaring Bitmap organization on GitHub counting over 40 programmers. We maintain a portable format specification.
 RoaringBitmap is a widely used, optimized and robust Java library. It supports both regular and off-heap (e.g., memory mapped) bitmaps. The CRoaring library is a C/C++ library that provides an optimized implementation of Roaring for C/C++ programmers. It works under Windows (Visual Studio), Linux (ARM and x64) and macOS.  We have Python libraries wrapping our C code: PyRoaringBitMap and python-croaring.</description>
